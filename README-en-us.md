# glitch-art-bot-scripts

Here you'll find the scripts (or sketches, if you prefer) used by [Glitch Art Bot](https://github.com/friaca/glitch-art-bot-ts).

Each script has its own folder and in each folder, its customization options.

_PS.: The user that mentions the bot aswell as the user that posted the tweet with the image **CAN'T** have its tweets "protected", for the bot won't the able to see the tweets._

## Basic usage

Reply to a tweet mentioning the bot (@GlitchArtBot) with the desired script, for example `@GlitchArtBot script-name`.

\*_If you only mention the bot and don't inform the script, it will glitch the photo with the default options, which is, `pixelsort mode=2 photo=1`._

## Advanced usage

Choose what script you want to edit your photo with, inform the [script's name](#available-scripts) options values and reply to the tweet. For example, if I want to glitch the fourth image of a tweet with the black mode of the Pixel Sort script, I need to reply to the tweet with `@GlitchArtBot pixelsort mode=2 photo=4`.

To know what options are available for each script, click the script name in the "**Available scripts**" section.

\*_The order of the options doesn't matter._

## Global options

These options are compatible with all scripts.
